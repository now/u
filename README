# U #

U extends Ruby’s support for Unicode.  It provides an interface that can be
used from both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 and implements its methods completely
separately from those in Ruby 1.9.

## Installation ##

Install u with

    % gem install u

## Usage ##

For now, take a look at the tests to see some examples of how to load the
library and use the methods.

It’s basically the following:

    require 'u'

    a = 'äbc'
    a.u.upcase # ⇒ 'ÄBC'
    a.upcase # ⇒ 'äBC'
    a # ⇒ 'äbc'
    a.u!.upcase # ⇒ 'ÄBC'
    a.upcase # ⇒ 'ÄBC'

## Future ##

Currently, most of my time is spent at my day job and in my (again flourishing)
private life. Please motivate me to spend time on this library by donating some
of your money to this project. Yeah, I realize that requesting money to develop
software is a bit, well, capitalistic of me. But please realize that I live in
a capitalistic society and I need money to have other people give me the things
that I need to continue living under the rules of said society. So, if you feel
that this library has helped you out enough to warrant a reward, please PayPal
a donation to now@bitwi.se.  Thanks!  Your support won’t go unnoticed!
